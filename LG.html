        <h1>Farming</h1>
        <p><b>Farming is the practice of cultivating soil, growing crops, and raising livestock for food, fiber, and other products.
        It involves various techniques and technologies to optimize production and sustainability. Farming can be categorized
        into subsistence (small-scale for local consumption) and commercial (large-scale for profit). Key factors include soil
        health, water management, and crop rotation. Modern farming increasingly incorporates innovations like precision
        agriculture, biotechnology, and sustainable practices to address challenges such as climate change and food security.</b></p>

        <h1>Cereals</h1>
        <p><b>Cereals are grasses cultivated for their edible seeds, known as grains. Major types include wheat, rice, corn (maize),
        barley, oats, and sorghum. They are staple foods for a large portion of the global population, providing essential
        carbohydrates, proteins, and nutrients. Cereals are used in various forms, from whole grains to processed products like
        flour, cereals, and snacks. They play a crucial role in agriculture, economies, and diets worldwide, and are also
        important for livestock feed. Sustainable farming practices are increasingly being adopted to enhance cereal production
        while minimizing environmental impact.</b></p>
